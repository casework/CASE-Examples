# Cell site examples

This illustration includes example investigative questions that require cell site information, and sample JSON-LD of using the proposed `CellSiteFacet`, `AntennaFacet`, and `CapturedTelecommunicationsInformationFacet`.

The importance of standardizing representation of Cell Site information is evident from errors in processing location-based mobile device evidence that prompted Danish authorities to review over 10,000 cases ([Flaws in Cellphone Evidence Prompt Review of 10,000 Verdicts in Denmark, New York Times, 20 August 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/world/europe/denmark-cellphone-data-courts.html)).


## State of this Illustration

This illustration has been written in support of a Change Proposal under design and discussion, and hence may change in response to the proposal's evolution. New ontology concepts are in the file [drafting.ttl](drafting.ttl).

A total JSON-LD file of the data on this page, plus supplementary data needed to support queries, is available here: [JSON](cell_tower.json).


## Example - Connected Cell Sites(s)

The primary requirement of this proposal is to represent data showing which cell site(s) a given mobile device connected to during a specific time period. This information addresses the question of what location area(s) the mobile device was near during a time of interest.

*Observations*: The following shows Cell Site information extracted using Cellebrite from the Samsung device in the shared [Crossover](https://caseontology.org/examples/crossover/) dataset, contained within the file `/root/data/com.google.android.gms/databases/herrevad`.

Properties of the Cell Site represented in CASE using the proposed `CellSiteFacet`. The term Cell Site refers to a radio network component that has an antenna with associated properties.

```json
@CELL_TOWER_SITE_JSON@
```

The location of a Cell Site can change over time when it is moved by a telecommunication provider. Therefore, the location is represented using a `Location` object and a `Relationship` object, which can be time bounded:

```json
        {
            "@id": "kb:f2e90997-16c9-4822-be30-fa4f36553768",
            "@type": "uco-location:Location",
            "uco-core:hasFacet": [
                {
                    "@type": "uco-location:LatLongCoordinatesFacet",
                    "uco-location:latitude": {
                        "@type": "xsd:decimal",
                        "@value": "46.522316"
                    },
                    "uco-location:longitude": {
                        "@type": "xsd:decimal",
                        "@value": "6.566640"
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "@id": "kb:cdf48c35-c65d-41e4-843b-720f1ad24ab3",
            "@type": "uco-observable:ObservableRelationship",
            "uco-observable:startTime": {
                "@type": "xsd:dateTime",
                "@value": "2016-12-12T09:10:11Z"
            },
            "uco-observable:endTime": {
                "@type": "xsd:dateTime",
                "@value": "2018-06-10T15:36:39Z"
            },
            "uco-core:source": {
                "@id": "kb:dc9b8413-f681-4bc6-a66e-b70a7ecde4d4"
            },
            "uco-core:target": {
                "@id": "kb:f2e90997-16c9-4822-be30-fa4f36553768"
            },
            "uco-core:kindOfRelationship": "Located_At",
            "uco-core:isDirectional": true
        },
```


### Query - To which Cell Sites did the Mobile Device connect

To answer the question "Which Cell Site(s) did a given mobile device connect to during the period of interest?" In this example, the result is the connected Cell Site(s) during the specified time period.

| ?cellSiteIdentifier | ?cellSiteLocationAreaCode |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 29220952 | 22100 |

Information represented using the `CellSiteFacet` provides the location of the Cell Site, not the specific location of the connected mobile device. However, this information is necessary for cell site analysts to form an opinion about where the mobile device was most likely located during a time of interest ([Structuring the Evaluation of Location-Related Mobile Device Evidence, DFRWS EU 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsidi.2020.300928)).

Mistakes in analysing Cell Site information can result from incorrect location or cell identification information, as well as misinterpreted timestamps (e.g., incorrect timezone).

Cell Site information can also be used to determine which mobile devices were connected to a given Cell Site during a specific time period. This information answers the question of what devices were near a location of interest during a period of interest.


## Example - Captured Cell Site Information

Cell Site information can also be obtained from Call Detail Records (CDR) and wiretap data captured by telecommunication providers (specified by ETSI TS 102 232-5).

*Observations*: The following shows a subset of data that telecommunication providers captured from a Cell Site.

The proposed `CapturedTelecommunicationsInformationFacet` represents the subset of information that is most commonly useful for cyber-investigations:

```json
        {
            "@id": "kb:9dcd8413-f681-4bc6-a66e-b70a7ecd3e4a",
            "@type": "uco-observable:ObservableObject",
            "uco-core:hasFacet": [
                {
                    "@type": "drafting:CapturedTelecommunicationsInformationFacet",
                    "drafting:captureCellSite": {
                        "@id": "kb:dc9b8413-f681-4bc6-a66e-b70a7ecde4d4"
                    },
                    "uco-observable:captureStartTime": {
                        "@type": "xsd:dateTime",
                        "@value": "2021-07-29T01:23:02Z"
                    },
                    "uco-observable:captureEndTime": {
                        "@type": "xsd:dateTime",
                        "@value": "2021-07-30T02:10:50Z"
                    },
                    "drafting:partySubscription": {
                        "@id": "kb:4b3cdcbd-6a31-462f-be9b-1ca2944c8876"
                    },
                    "drafting:partyDevice": {
                        "@id": "kb:3fef85a7-3fb4-4170-ba4d-fc69e2de4789"
                    },
                    "drafting:interceptedCallState": "idle"
                }
            ]
        }
```

This captured telecommunication information can also answer questions about the activities on a given device during the connection with a Cell Site, including details about the connected device identifier, SIM card identifier, mobile phone number, called phone number, call status, and SMS message text. These details are already covered by other CASE/UCO facets.
