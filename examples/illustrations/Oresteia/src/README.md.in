# Oresteia Example

This example was developed for the 2017 Digital Investigation paper to show
how CASE can represent multiple related criminal investigations. This
example refers to a trilogy of Greek tragedies written by Aeschylus in and
collectively called The Oresteia. For illustrative purposes, the characters
of these ancient stories are given access to modern technology.


## Investigations

These are the multiple investigations illustrated in this example (with SPARQL source `src/query-investgations.sparql`):

@QUERY_INVESTIGATIONS_MD@

<details>

<summary>SPARQL source - `query-investigations.sparql`</summary>

```sparql
@QUERY_INVESTIGATIONS_SPARQL@
```

</details>


## People

These are the people mentioned throughout the graph:

@QUERY_PEOPLE_MD@

<details>

<summary>SPARQL source - `query-people.sparql`</summary>

```sparql
@QUERY_PEOPLE_SPARQL@
```

</details>

These are the investigations in which the people are generically linked:

@QUERY_PEOPLE_INVESTIGATIONS_MD@

<details>

<summary>SPARQL source - `query-people-investigations`</summary>

```sparql
@QUERY_PEOPLE_INVESTIGATIONS_SPARQL@
```

</details>
