The relationship between cryptoAddresses and the verified owner can be represented as follows:

```json
       {
            "@id": "kb:cryptoaddress-ownedby-relationship-uuid",
            "@type": "uco-core:Relationship",
            "uco-core:source": {
                "@id": "kb:cryptoAddress1-uuid"
            },
            "uco-core:target": {
                "@id": "kb:ShaunBridgesIdentity-uuid"
            },
            "uco-core:kindOfRelationship": "Owned_By",
            "uco-core:isDirectional": true
